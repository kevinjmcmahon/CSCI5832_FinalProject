## **Introduction**

In this project, we explore the detection of online polarization across multiple languages and cultural contexts. The goal is to develop a system that can accurately identify polarized text, classify its type, and identify how that polarization is manifested. Our approach utilizes [mention your high-level approach, e.g., transformer-based models, multilingual embeddings] to tackle this challenging NLP task.

## **Task Description**

SemEval 2026 Task 9 focuses on identifying online polarization. The task is broken down into the following subtasks:

*   **Subtask 1: Polarization Detection:** Identifying whether a text exhibits polarization.
*   **Subtask 2: Polarization Type Classification:** Classifying polarized content into specific types (e.g., political, social).
*   **Subtask 3: Manifestation Identification:** Determining how the polarization is expressed.

This project will focus on each of the subtasks. The dataset provided for this task includes text in over 20 languages. Our models created will be trained using 5 languages that are still to be decided.

## **Getting Started**

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   Python (3.8+)
*   pip
*   [Any other major dependencies like PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.]

### **Installation**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-repository-name].git
    cd [your-repository-name]
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## **Usage**

This section explains how to use the code in this repository.

### **Data**

The data for this task can be obtained from the [Official SemEval 2026 Task 9 website]([https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2026/](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/10522/)). Once downloaded, place the data in the `/data` directory.

### **Training**

To train a new model, run the following command:

```bash
python src/train.py --model [model_name] --data_path data/ --output_path models/
```

### **Evaluation**

To evaluate a trained model, use the evaluation script

```bash
python src/evaluate.py --model_path models/[model_name] --test_data_path data/test.csv
```

## **Methodology**

Our approach to this task involves [describe your methodology in a few paragraphs. For example, mention the architecture of your model(s), any pre-processing steps, and the overall workflow]. We experimented with several techniques, including [mention some of the techniques you tried].

## **Results**

The performance of our final model on the validation set is as follows:

| Subtask                      | Metric | Score |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| [e.g., Polarization Detection] | [e.g., F1] | [e.g., 0.85] |
| ...                          | ...    | ...   |

A more detailed analysis of our results can be found in our final project report.
